Q U E S T I O N S :

1. why are the pictures not loading---displaying on my browser?  
2. how can i add a default city for the first route so that id does not crash if no city is passed 
3. Can I have more than one route per web page? doesnt seem to run well with two toutes per page
4.I should have asked betters q's to the interviewer, made some assumptions like: user has to input city, 
and does the program deliver the mood or does the user? what is the action desired from picking a mood?



flask run
---------------------------dropdown list that is not hardcoded If I were to use a mood dictionary or api 
   <form action="/mood_message" method="GET">
                
                    <select name="mood" class="form-select form-select-lg m-3" aria-label=".form-select-lg example">
                            {% for mood in my_mood %}
                        <option value="{{ mood }}">{{ mood }}</option>
                            {% endfor %}
                    </select>
                    <button class="btn btn-outline-warning" type="submit">Get your mood message</button>
        
                </form>
